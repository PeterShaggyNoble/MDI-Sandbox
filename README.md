## Background
A while back we began to drop Font Awesome from our projects in favour of the much more comprehensive Material Design Icons but, so used were we to icons page on FA's website, we struggled at times to find the icons we needed on the MDI website or cheatsheet. So I threw together my own cheatsheet with the initial focus being on better categorising the icons and adding some keywords to help with searching. As it was something that was only we were going to be using, I also used it as an opportunity to play around with a few things I don't normally get to play with in my everyday work, such as [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) and, more importantly, ECMAScript 6. But then it grew, especially once [Templarian](https://github.com/Templarian) invited me to be a collaborator on the main MDI project and I started thinking about more possibilities for use by a wider audience. I recently decided to make this a community project to allow others to help with keeping it updated and with the categorisation icons so took it as an opportunity to start properly familiarising myself with GitHub, and here we are!
