## Read First
1. **Important Note:** This is a side-project to the main [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) project. To request a new icon, suggest an alias or make a contribution to the icon pack, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/issues) in the main repository.
2. This repository is currently a work in progress, being my first project on GitHub. As such, please refrain from submitting any pull requests for now. If you have a request or suggestion then please [submit an issue](https://github.com/PeterShaggyNoble/MDI-Sandbox/issues) instead.

## Standalone Version
A single-file, standalone version is now available, which you can find in the [`standalone`](https://github.com/PeterShaggyNoble/MDI-Sandbox/tree/master/standalone) directory. It can be run locally ~but note that it does currently need access to the internet in order to download the Roboto font from Google~. Also, unless you run the file through a web server, it can't access `window.localStorage` and, therefore, all functionality related to favourites is disabled.

## Background
A while back we began to drop Font Awesome from our projects in favour of the much more comprehensive Material Design Icons but, so used were we to the icons page on FA's website, we struggled at times to find the icons we needed on the MDI website or cheatsheet. So I threw together my own cheatsheet with the initial focus being on better categorising the icons and adding some keywords to help with searching (both of which proved to be sizable jobs!). As it was something that only we were going to be using, I also used it as an opportunity to play around with a few things I don't normally get to play with in my everyday work back then, such as [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) and, more importantly, ECMAScript 6. But then it grew, especially once [Templarian](https://github.com/Templarian) invited me to be a collaborator on the main MDI project and I started thinking about more possibilities for use by a wider audience. I recently decided to make this a community project to allow others to help with keeping it updated and with the categorisation icons so took it as an opportunity to start properly familiarising myself with GitHub, and here we are!
